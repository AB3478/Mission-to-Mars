# Mission-to-Mars

#### A junior data scientist does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. She is interested in working for NASA so she spends a significant amount of time visiting sites with news about space exploration, especially the mission to Mars. She’s interested in gathering data about the mission to Mars from all over the web and displaying it in a central location. She would like to include images of Mars’s hemispheres online and alter her web app to accommodate these images.
